# Covid-Timeline
This project is a simple tool that allows users to compare the number of CoViD-19 cases among 207 countries and regions. It was created using Plotly Dash in Python.

## The Data
The data comes from this dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases 

## The goal
Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash which lets users select different countries to view a line graph of recorded covid cases.

Try to get this to display nicely and conveniently for my portfolio. Maybe include appropriate screenshots as well as a link that someone could follow.

I have plans to host this on Heroku, or a similar platform.
