# Covid-Timeline
A global timeline of the Covid-19 pandemic, using a verified dataset.

## The Data
The data comes from this dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases 

## The goal
Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash which lets users select different countries to view a line graph of recorded covid cases.

Try to get this to display nicely and conveniently for my portfolio. Maybe include appropriate screenshots as well as a link that someone could follow.
